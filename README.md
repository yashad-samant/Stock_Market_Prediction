# Stock_Market_Prediction
Basically, it was a research assignment where I learnt more about the time series analysis and prediction. The whole project was implemented without any machine learning frameworks and everything was implemented from scratch. I got an accuracy of 94%, 91% and 87% for train, test and validate data-sets respectively. More details can be found in the report posted below.
